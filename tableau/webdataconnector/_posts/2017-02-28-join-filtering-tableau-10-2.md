With the release of Tableau 10.2 comes a new feature for multi-table connectors.
You can now use join filtering to filter the data from one table based on the data from another table.
This minimizes requests to your data source for improved data access speeds and reduced server loads.
For more information, see [Join Filtering]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/wdc_join_filtering) in the documentation.
