# DCMAP

## Getting Started

All JavaScript dependencies are currently pulled from CDNs in the `index.html` file, so all you have to do is:
1. Serve the application using any means (double click the HTML file, use a VS Code browser extension like "Live Server", etc)


## Continuous development

1. Ensure all steps above are complete
2. Edit the `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` files
3. Run the application using any means (e.g. double click the HTML file, use a VS Code extension like "Live Server", etc)
