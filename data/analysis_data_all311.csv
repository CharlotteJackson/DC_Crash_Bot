DDOT looks at the speeds at which most drivers travel to determine the speeds that the physical environment allows. The 85th percentile speed is used extensively in the field of traffic engineering and safety to characterize the speeds at which reasonable and prudent drivers travel given the geometric and operational constraints of the roadway. DDOT%e2%80%99s eligibility criteria require that the 85th percentile speed of vehicles (measured over a 48-hour period) must exceed the posted speed limit by at least 25 percent in order to qualify for traffic calming measures. In other words%2c at least 15 percent of drivers must exceed the speed limit by a minimum of 25 percent for traffic calming measures to be considered which would enable physical changes to be made to the roadway. In this case%2c the measured 85th percentile speed is 21 MPH%3b therefore%2c DDOT will not make physical changes to the block.%0a,0101000020E61000004A64FC6E783D53C052E8DA5A1B724340,728557,CLOSED,,,,,,,,
